# Lending Club Case Study
> A consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers, has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
> The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
> To identify the risky loan applicants, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss considerably
