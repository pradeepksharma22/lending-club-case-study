# Lending Club Case Study
> The main objective of this case study is to be able to identify risky loan applicants for the lending club. Such that these loans can be identified at the early stages and minimized, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Idea is to perform an EDA analysis to understand the driving factors which are strong indicators of loan defaults. The company can utilize this case study for its risk assessment.

> We have developed this case study as part of the EDA Module for the Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning & AI - IIIT,Bangalore.
